# Tutorial For Intro to Markdown
### Created by Akshay Buddharaju 

This Tutorial is directed towards people who have no experience in Markdown.

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

Taking cues from existing conventions for marking up plain text in email such as setext, the language was designed to be readable as-is, without looking like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions, unlike text which has been formatted with a Markup language, such as HTML, which has obvious tags and formatting instructions. Markdown is a formatting syntax for text that can be read by humans and can be easily converted to HTML.
